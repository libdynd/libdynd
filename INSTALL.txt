PREREQUISITES
=============

This library requires a C++98 compiler. [TODO: pick supported
compiler versions and list them here. Should set up build/test
infrastructure for supported configurations.]

 * CMake >= 1.6
 * Boost (header-only, doesn't require that any libraries be built)

For the Python exposure, the following are also needed.

 * Python 2.7
 * Cython >= 0.16
 * Numpy >= 1.6

The following libraries/projects are included with the code:

 * Google Test 1.6 (included in project)

BUILD AND INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS
==============================

CMake is the only supported build system for this library. This
may expand in the future, but for the time being this is the
only one which will be kept up to date.

Windows
-------

    1a. Run CMake-gui. For the 'source code' folder, choose the
        dynamicndarray folder which is the root of the project.
        For the 'build the binaries' folder, create a 'build'
        subdirectory so that your build is isolated from the
        source code files. Visual Studio 2010 is recommended,
        and will work even though Python 2.7 is built with
        2008. Double-click on the generated dynamicndarray.sln
        to open Visual Studio.

    1b. Start a command prompt window, and navigate to the
        dynamicndarray folder which is the root of the project.
        The execute the following commands:

        D:\dynamicndarray>mkdir build
        D:\dynamicndarray>cd build
        D:\dynamicndarray\build>cmake -G "Visual Studio 10 Win64" ..
           [output, check it for errors]
        D:\dynamicndarray\build>start dynamicndarray.sln
           [Visual Studio should start and load the project]

    2. The RelWithDebInfo configuration is recommended for most
       purposes. The Debug configuration tries to link against
       a debug build of Python, even though that isn't necessarily
       desired.

    3. To install the Python module, explicitly build the INSTALL
       target.

Linux
-----

    Execute the following commands from the dynamicndarray folder,
    which is the root of the project:
      $ mkdir build
      $ cd build
      $ cmake ..
      $ make
      $ make install # or "sudo make install"

Mac OS X
--------

    Execute the following commands from the dynamicndarray folder,
    which is the root of the project:
      $ mkdir build
      $ cd build
      $ cmake -DCMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES=i386 -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/usr/bin/clang++ -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=/usr/bin/clang -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-stdlib=libc++"  ..
      $ make
      $ make install # or "sudo make install"
